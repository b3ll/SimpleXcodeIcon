SimpleXcodeIcon
=============

Ditches any sort of modifications to the Xcode dock icon!

When the Xcode 6.3 betas started, Apple started including the Xcode version number plastered overtop Xcode's dock icon if you've got the internal menu turned on (ShowDVTDebugMenu). This made me sad, because it looks bad.

This plugin removes that! :D
